1. Clone it or download as zip package into the libraries forlder of your arduino IDE
2. Open the example sketch to see how to use it.

Basically it has a few functions, you feed it a float value that you increment/decrement linearly in a for loop and it returns it's non linear equivalent depending on the function you call.
The input value must be a float between 0.0 and 100.0, and the returned value is also a float between 0.0 and 100.0. Linear percentage in - Non linear percentage out.

This is what it does:
